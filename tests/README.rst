Test suite
==========

Tests are split into three folders:

* unit: these are for tests that exercise a single unit of functionality, like a single model.
* integration: these are for tests that exercise a collection or chain of units, like testing a template tag.
* functional: these should be as close to "end-to-end" as possible. Most of these tests should simulate the behaviour of a user browsing a website.
