*Django-machina* is a forum framework for Django providing a way to build community-driven websites. It offers a full-featured yet very extensible forum solution :

* Topic and post editing
* Forums tree management
* Per-forum permissions
* Anonymous posting
* Polls and attachments
* ...

*Django-machina* was built with integration in mind : the application is designed to be used inside existing Django applications and it is not self-sufficient.

*Django-machina* was built with customization and extensibility in mind : each single functionality of the application can be customized or overriden to accommodate with your needs. In fact, *django-machina* uses the same techniques as those introduced by the famous django-oscar_ e-commerce framework to allow powerfull customizations.

**This application is in heavy development. It is not yet suitable for production environments.**
